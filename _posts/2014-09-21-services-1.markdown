  When one is scared or afraid, the body automatically responds by an increase in heart rate, pulse, and respiration, all functioning to tell the brain to run away and get to safety. This has become known as the fight or flight response and is universal to all humans. Autonomous, worn as a patch on the body inconspicuously, monitors these physiologic responses constantly. When fight or flight conditions activate, Autonomous communicates to the identified contacts that help is needed with the the wearers location.
